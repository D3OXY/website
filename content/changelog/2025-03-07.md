title: The latest updates from Neon

## TBD

<details>

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon Console**

- **Postgres extension updates**

  The PostgreSQL Anonymizer (`anon`) extension, which was not officially supported in Neon but was enabled for some users during early testing, will be removed. Data anonymization support is planned for delivery in Q2 2025. We will contact known `anon` extension users via email before its removal. If you are using the `anon` extension and have questions or concerns, please reach out to [Neon Support](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=support).

- **Drizzle Studio update**

  We updated the Drizzle Studio integration that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console to version 1.0.17. For the latest improvements and fixes, see the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
