## High-performance analytics in Postgres with pg_duckdb üìä

We‚Äôre excited to introduce support for [pg_duckdb](https://github.com/duckdb/pg_duckdb), a Postgres extension that brings the DuckDB analytics engine to Postgres. With `pg_duckdb`, you can run high-performance analytical queries directly within your Postgres environment, making complex queries on large datasets super-fast. Take advantage of DuckDB‚Äôs columnar storage and vectorized execution to accelerate your analytics workloads.

To get started, request access through [Neon Support](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=support), then follow our [pg_duckdb extension guide](/docs/extensions/pg_duckdb).

## A new command for the Neon MCP Server üõ†Ô∏è

We're continuing to build [Neon MCP Server](https://github.com/neondatabase-labs/mcp-server-neon) capabilities. This week we added support for new `get_connection_string` command that returns your your database connection string. 

If you haven't tried the Neon MCP Server yet, follow one of our guides to get started. Spin up databases instantly, run queries, and perform migrations using natural language in any IDE or AI tool that supports the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/mcp).

### A Neon Slack App update üí¨

We've been fine-tuning the Neon Slack App that we first introduced it back in January. If you haven't tried it   yet, see the [documentation](/docs/manage/slack-app) for setup instructions.

Here are the commands it supports to help you manage and monitor your Neon projects:

- `/neon auth` - Connect Slack to your Neon account
- `/neon projects` - List your Neon projects
- `/neon usage` - Show overall resource usage for your account
- `/neon help` - List all available commands
- `/neon status` - Check the current status of Neon's cloud service
- `/neon feedback` - Share your thoughts and suggestions about the Neon Slack App
- `/neon projects usage` - Show resource usage for a specific project
- `/neon projects shared` - List all projects shared with you
- `/neon invite user` - Invite users to your organization

We‚Äôd love to hear your feedback. Use the `/neon feedback` command in Slack to share your thoughts.

## Get started faster with new Neon projects ‚ö°

We've added a **Getting started** widget to the **Project Dashboard** to help you set up new Neon projects faster. You'll see this widget whenever you create a new Neon project. It provides quick access to getting started actions and instructions:

- **Connect to your database** ‚Äì Easily find your database connection details.
- **Import your data** ‚Äì Bring your data to Neon with a few clicks.
- **Get sample data** ‚Äì Load sample datasets to experiment with Neon.
- **View database contents** ‚Äì Manage tables and data directly from the dashboard.

- **Neon Console**

  We've repositioned the "new query" button in the Neon SQL Editor, bringing it a little closer to the action. You'll now find it at the top of the editor.

- **Postgres extension update**

  The PostgreSQL Anonymizer (`anon`) extension, which was not officially supported in Neon but enabled for some users for evaluation, will be removed. Data anonymization support continues to be on our 2025 roadmap. We will contact known `anon` extension users directly by email before we fully remove the extension. If you are using the `anon` extension and have questions or concerns, please reach out to [Neon Support](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=support).

- **Drizzle Studio update**

  We updated the Drizzle Studio integration that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console to version 1.0.17. For the latest improvements and fixes, see the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
