## Get started with new a Neon project on the Project Dashboard

We've added a **Getting started** widget to the **Project Dashboard** to help you set up new Neon projects faster. You'll see this widget when creating a new Neon project. It provides quick access to essential actions and instructions:

- **Connect to your database** – Easily find your database connection details.
- **Import your data** – Bring your data to Neon with a few clicks.
- **Get sample data** – Load sample datasets to experiment with Neon.
- **View database contents** – Manage tables and data directly from the dashboard.

## HackerOne

<details>

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon Console**

- **Postgres extension updates**

  The PostgreSQL Anonymizer (`anon`) extension, which was not officially supported in Neon but was enabled for some users during early testing, will be removed. Data anonymization support is planned for delivery in Q2 2025. We will contact known `anon` extension users via email before its removal. If you are using the `anon` extension and have questions or concerns, please reach out to [Neon Support](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=support).

- **Drizzle Studio update**

  We updated the Drizzle Studio integration that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console to version 1.0.17. For the latest improvements and fixes, see the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
