## HIPAA Compliance

Neon is now HIPAA compliant. This means we can support applications that require HIPAA compliance, including those that process Protected Health Information (PHI). For more information about our HIPAA compliance, please visit our [Trust Center](https://trust.neon.tech/).

## Feature A

## Feature B

<details>

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon Console**

  Updated AWS region names to match their official AWS identifiers (e.g., "AWS US East 1" instead of "AWS US East"), making it easier to identify familiar regions when creating a new project.
