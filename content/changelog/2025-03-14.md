## HIPAA Compliance

Neon is now HIPAA compliant. This means we can support applications that require HIPAA compliance, including those that process Protected Health Information (PHI). For more information about our HIPAA compliance, please visit our [Trust Center](https://trust.neon.tech/).

## Neon joins GitHub's Secret Scanning Partner Program

Neon is now a GitHub Secret Scanning Partner, helping protect users by automatically detecting exposed Neon database credentials and API keys in public repositories and npm packages. When a credential is detected, GitHub notifies Neon, triggering alerts to our security team and affected users. This integration adds an extra layer of security, ensuring leaked credentials are identified and mitigated before they can be exploited.

## Feature B

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon Console**

  Updated AWS region names to match their official AWS identifiers (e.g., "AWS US East 1" instead of "AWS US East"), making it easier to identify familiar regions when creating a new project.
