## Neon is now HIPAA Compliant

We're pleased to announce that Neon is now HIPAA compliant.

HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) is a U.S. law that sets national standards for the protection of personal health information (PHI) and regulates how healthcare providers, insurers, and business associates handle electronic health records (EHRs).

If you develop applications that must comply with HIPAA, you can now build on Neon. HIPAA is available as an add-on to Neon's Business and Enterprise plans. To get started, reach out to the [Neon Sales team](https://neon.tech/contact-sales). They'll work with you on a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) and enable HIPAA for your account. Read the blog post for more: [Neon is HIPAA Compliant](https://neon.tech/blog/hipaa).

Business and Enterprise customers can request a copy of Neon's HIPAA compliance report through our [Trust Center](https://trust.neon.tech/).

## Neon joins GitHub's Secret Scanning Partner Program

Neon is now a GitHub Secret Scanning Partner, helping protect users by automatically detecting exposed Neon database credentials and API keys in public repositories and npm packages. When a credential is detected, GitHub notifies Neon, triggering alerts to our security team and affected users. This integration adds an extra layer of security, ensuring leaked credentials are identified and mitigated before they can be exploited.

## "LAST" login indicator

In case you missed it, we've added a simple **LAST** tag on our login screen that shows which authentication method you previously used. No more guessing which login method to choose when returning to Neon!

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon Console**

  Updated AWS region names to match their official AWS identifiers (e.g., "AWS US East 1" instead of "AWS US East"), making it easier to identify familiar regions when creating a new project.

- **Organization billing**

  Added support for organizations to [downgrade](/docs/manage/orgs-manage#downgrade-to-free-plan) to the Free plan, with clear visibility into any applicable limitations before downgrading.
