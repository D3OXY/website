## HIPAA Compliance

Neon is now HIPAA compliant. This means we can support applications that require HIPAA compliance, including those that process Protected Health Information (PHI). For more information about our HIPAA compliance, please visit our [Trust Center](https://trust.neon.tech/).

## Neon joins GitHub's Secret Scanning Partner Program

Neon is now a GitHub Secret Scanning Partner, helping protect users by automatically detecting exposed Neon database credentials and API keys in public repositories and npm packages. When a credential is detected, GitHub notifies Neon, triggering alerts to our security team and affected users. This integration adds an extra layer of security, ensuring leaked credentials are identified and mitigated before they can be exploited.

## "LAST" login indicator

In case you missed it, we've added a simple **LAST** tag on our login screen that shows which authentication method you previously used. No more guessing which login method to choose when returning to Neon!

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon Console**

  Updated AWS region names to match their official AWS identifiers (e.g., "AWS US East 1" instead of "AWS US East"), making it easier to identify familiar regions when creating a new project.

- **Organization billing**

  Added support for organizations to [downgrade](/docs/manage/orgs-manage#downgrade-to-free-plan) to the Free plan, with clear visibility into any applicable limitations before downgrading.

- **Drizzle Studio update**

  We updated the Drizzle Studio integration that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console to version 1.0.XX. For the latest improvements and fixes, see the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
