## Neon is now HIPAA compliant âœ…

Neon is now fully HIPAA compliant, adding to our existing security certifications (SOC 2 Type 2, ISO 27001, ISO 27701) and regulatory alignments (GDPR, CCPA). With this certification, Neon can now support any application that requires HIPAA compliance, including those that process Protected Health Information (PHI). For more information about our HIPAA compliance, visit our [Trust Center](https://trust.neon.tech/).

## Neon joins GitHub's Secret Scanning Partner Program ðŸ”’

Neon is now a GitHub Secret Scanning Partner, helping protect users by automatically detecting exposed Neon database credentials and API keys in public repositories and npm packages. When a credential is detected, GitHub notifies Neon, triggering alerts to our security team and affected users. This integration adds an extra layer of security, ensuring leaked credentials are identified and mitigated before they can be exploited.

## "LAST" login indicator

We've added a simple **LAST** tag on our login screen that shows which authentication method you previously used. No more guessing which login method to choose when returning to Neon!

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon Console**
  - Updated AWS region names to match their official AWS identifiers (e.g., "AWS US East 1" instead of "AWS US East"), making it easier to identify familiar regions when creating a new project.

  - The Console now remembers your last selected connection format (like Node.js, Python, or psql), automatically showing your preferred format when you return to the connection drawer.
  - Improved SQL Editor responsiveness by unlocking the Run button more quickly after query execution.

- **Neon API**
  - Added consistent email validation across all endpoints (1-256 characters).

- **1Password integration**

  Improved how connection strings are saved in 1Password - now stores the complete connection string in a single field for easier copy/paste functionality.

- **Organization billing**

  Added support for organizations to [downgrade](/docs/manage/orgs-manage#downgrade-to-free-plan) to the Free plan, with clear visibility into any applicable limitations before downgrading.

- **Drizzle Studio update**

  We updated the Drizzle Studio integration that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console to version 1.0.XX. For the latest improvements and fixes, see the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
