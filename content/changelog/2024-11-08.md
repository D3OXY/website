### At a glance usage metrics for paid plan users

We're making it easier for paid plan users to check how much room you've got left on your account-level metrics. Find it on your **Projects** page.

And we've also added a project-level usage widget on the Project Dashbaord as well, letting you know your current consumption levels for the month for each individual project.

### Postgres extension updates

Now available on **Postgres 17**:

| Extension     | Version |
| :------------ | :------ |
| pg_jsonschema | 0.3.3   |
| pg_graphql    | 1.5.9   |
| rum           | 1.3.1   |
| pg_tiktoken   | 0.0.1   |

In addition, we updated the following extension versions on **Postgres 14, 15, and 16**:

| Extension     | Old Version | New Version |
| :------------ | :---------- | :---------- |
| pg_jsonschema | 0.3.1       | 0.3.3       |
| pg_graphql    | 1.5.7       | 1.9         |

For a complete list of Postgres extensions supported by Neon, see [Postgres extensions](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions).

### Branch archiving

On the Free plan, Neon now automatically archives branches that are **older than 14 days** and **have not been accessed for the past 24 hours**. No action is required to unarchive a branch. It happens automatically when you access the branch. Branch archiving will be introduced on paid plans at a later date.

To learn more, see [Branch archiving](/docs/guides/branch-archiving).

And don't forget to check out this week's fixes and improvements:

<details>

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon Authorize**

  Neon Authorize is now supported on Postgres 17. This recently introduced feature lets you move Postgres Row-Level Security (RLS) policies into your codebase. To learn more, read the [announcement](https://neon.tech/blog/introducing-neon-authorize) or check out the [docs](/guides/neon-authorize).

- **Neon Vercel Integration**

  The Neon Vercel Integration is now supported on Organization-owned projects.

- **Neon CLI enhancements**

  The Neon CLI was updated to version 2.4.0. For upgrade instructions, see [Upgrading the Neon CLI](https://neon.tech/docs/reference/cli-install#upgrade).

  The `branches list` command now shows a branches `Current State`. Current branch states include:

  - `init` - the branch is being created but is not available for querying.
  - `ready` - the branch is fully operational and ready for querying. Expect normal query response times.
  - `archived` - the branch is stored in cost-effective archive storage. Expect slow query response times.

    ```bash
    neon branches list --project-id green-hat-46829796
    ┌───────────────────────────┬──────┬─────────┬───────────────┬──────────────────────┐
    │ Id                        │ Name │ Default │ Current State │ Created At           │
    ├───────────────────────────┼──────┼─────────┼───────────────┼──────────────────────┤
    │ br-muddy-firefly-a7kzf0d4 │ main │ true    │ ready         │ 2024-10-30T14:59:57Z │
    └───────────────────────────┴──────┴─────────┴───────────────┴──────────────────────┘
    ```

  The `Updated At` value was removed from the `branches list` command output. This value reflected internal metadata changes only, providing limited value.

- **Neon API updates**

  We've introduced several new endpoints for managing [Organizations](https://neon.tech/docs/manage/organizations) in Neon. The new endpoints include:

  - [Get organization details](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getorganization)
  - [Get organization members](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getorganizationmembers)
  - [Get organization member details](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getorganizationmember)
  - [Get organization invitation details](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getorganizationinvitations)
  - [Create organizations invitations](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createorganizationinvitations)

- **Fixes**

  - The previous query was not cleared after selecting a query from the **History** list in the **Neon SQL Editor**, causing the previous query to be run instead of the selected query.
  - Fixed an issue where resetting a branch from its parent regenerated passwords on the child branch. This should only occur when the parent branch is configured as a protected branch.
  - Fixed an issue on the **Monitoring** page where lines on the **RAM** and **Working set size** graphs overflowed the graph area.
  - Removed usage alerts from shared Neon projects. The alerts should only appear for project owners.
  - Added validation that prevents an Organization name field from being left blank when creating a new Organization.
  - Fix an issue with the **psql** `\help` or `\h` commands accessible via the Neon SQL Editor. The specified help page failed to display.

    <Admonition type="tip" title="Did you know?">
    The Neon SQL Editor supports `psql` meta-commands, which act like shortcuts for interacting with your database. If you are already familiar with using meta-commands from the `psql` command-line interface, you can use many of those same commands in the SQL Editor.

    To get a list of supported commands, use `\?`. For more info, see [meta-commands](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor#meta-commands) section of our [Query with Neon's SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor) docs page.
