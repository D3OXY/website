### Branch archiving

On the Free plan, Neon now automatically archives branches that are that are **older than 14 days** and **have not been accessed for the past 24 hours**. No action is required to unarchive a branch. It happens quickly and automatically when you connect to an archived branch, query it, or performing some other action that accesses the branch.

Currently, automatic archiving of inactive branches is only enabled on the Free Plan. It will be introduced on paid plans at a later date, where archiving of inactive branches to cost-efficient archive storage will help reduce storage costs.

To learn more, see [Branch archiving](/docs/guides/branch-archiving).
