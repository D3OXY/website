### At a glance usage metrics for paid plan users

We're making it easier for paid plan users to check how much room you've got left on your account-level metrics. Find it on your **Projects** page.

![account metrics widget on all projects page](/docs/relnotes/paid-plan/account_metrics_widget.png)

And we've also added a project-level usage widget on the Project Dashbaord as well, letting you know your current consumption levels for the month for each individual project.

### Postgres extension updates

We added support for several extensions to **Postgres 17**.

![create extension pgvector](/docs/relnotes/create_extension_pgvector.png)

Now available on **Postgres 17**:

| Extension    | Version |
| :----------- | :------ |
| pg_jsonschema| 0.3.3   |
| pg_graphql   | 1.5.9   |
| rum          | 1.3.1   |
| pg_tiktoken  | 0.0.1   |

In addition, we updated the following extension versions on **Postgres 14, 15, and 16**:

| Extension     | Old Version | New Version |
| :------------ | :---------- | :---------- |
| pg_jsonschema | 0.3.1       | 0.3.3       |
| pg_graphql    | 1.5.7       | 1.9         |

For a complete list of Postgres extensions supported by Neon and upgrade instructions, see [Postgres extensions](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions).

### Branch archiving

On the Free plan, Neon now automatically archives branches that are that are **older than 14 days** and **have not been accessed for the past 24 hours** in cost-efficient archive storage. No action is required to unarchive a branch. It happens quickly and automatically when you connect to an archived branch, query it, or performing some other action that accesses the branch.

Currently, automatic archiving of inactive branches is only enabled on the Free Plan. It will be introduced on paid plans at a later date, where archiving of inactive branches to cost-efficient archive storage will help reduce storage costs.

To learn more, see [Branch archiving](/docs/guides/branch-archiving).

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Contact support form improvements**:

  FF: You can now attach files along with your problem description when requesting help from Neon support. File size limit is 50 MB and we support the following file types:

  - PDF (.pdf)
  - PNG (.png)
  - JPEG (.jpeg)
  - GIF (.gif)
  - Text (.txt)

- **More local disk space for Neon computes**

  We increased the local disk space allocation for Neon computes, which will now receive 15 GiB x maximum vCPU setting with a minimum of 20 GiB. This change ensures optimal handling of temporary data, query operations, and maintenance tasks in Postgres.

- **Neon Console enhancements**
  - FF: The Organizations Members and Collaborators tables now support sorting.
  - The Neon Vercel Integration is now supported on Organization-owned projects.
  - The **psql** `\d` (describe) commands accessible via the Neon SQL Editor were updated for Postgres 17 compatibility.

- **Neon CLI enhancements**

  The Neon CLI was updated to version 2.4.0. For upgrade instructions, see [Upgrading the Neon CLI](https://neon.tech/docs/reference/cli-install#upgrade).
  
  The `branches list` command now shows a branches `Current State`. Current branch states include:

  - `init` - the branch is being created but is not available for querying.
  - `ready` - the branch is fully operational and ready for querying. Expect normal query response times.
  - `archived` - the branch is stored in cost-effective archive storage. Expect slow query response times.  

  ```bash
  neon branches list --project-id green-hat-46829796
  ┌───────────────────────────┬──────┬─────────┬───────────────┬──────────────────────┐
  │ Id                        │ Name │ Default │ Current State │ Created At           │
  ├───────────────────────────┼──────┼─────────┼───────────────┼──────────────────────┤
  │ br-muddy-firefly-a7kzf0d4 │ main │ true    │ ready         │ 2024-10-30T14:59:57Z │
  └───────────────────────────┴──────┴─────────┴───────────────┴──────────────────────┘
  ```

  The previously reported `Updated At` value was removed from the `branches list` output. This value reflected internal metadata changes only.


- **Neon Authorize** is now supported on Neon projects running Postgres 17. Previously, it was only available on Postgres 14, 15, and 16 projects.

    Neon Authorize lets you move Postgres Row-Level Security (RLS) policies into your codebase. To learn more, read the [announcement](https://neon.tech/blog/introducing-neon-authorize) or check out the [docs](/guides/neon-authorize).

- **Neon API changes**

We've introduced several new endpoints for managing Organizations. The new endpoints include:

- [Get organization details](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getorganization)
- [Get organization members](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getorganizationmembers)
- [Get organization member details](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getorganizationmember)
- [Get organization invitation details](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getorganizationinvitations)
- [Create organizations invitations](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createorganizationinvitations)

- **Fixes**

  - The previous state (the previous query) was not cleared after select a query from the **History** list in the **Neon SQL Editor**, causing the previous query to be run instead of the query that was selected from the **History** list.
  - Fixed an issue where resetting a branch from its parent regenerated passwords on the child branch, which should only occur when the parent branch is defined as a protected branch.
  - Fixed an issue on the **Monitoring** page where lines on the **RAM** and **Working set size** graphs overflowed the graph area.
  - Removed usage alerts from shared Neon projects. The alerts should only appear for project owners.
  - Add validation that prevents an Organization name from being left blank when creating a new Organization.
  - Fix an issue with the **psql** `\help` or `\h` commands accessible via the Neon SQL Editor. The specified help page failed to display.
