title: New safeguards for protected branches, Azure enhancements, and more

## New safeguards for protected branches

We added a warning and confirmation modal to the **SQL Editor** when running queries on [protected branches](/docs/guides/protected-branches). This helps prevent accidental changes to production data. You'll see a clear notice and must confirm before proceeding.

## Create Neon projects directly from the Azure Portal

For users of Neon on Azure — you can now create Neon projects directly from the Azure Portal. Creating a project is part of Neon Serverless Postgres resource creation. You can also add Neon projects to an existing Neon resource from a new **Projects** page. All Neon plans, including the Free plan, support creating multiple Neon projects.

## Support for Azure Service Connector

Another enhancement for users of Neon on Azure — you can now use [Azure Service Connector](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-connector/overview) to connect your applications to your Neon database. Azure Service Connector simplifies database connections by automatically handling credentials, networking, and configuration when linking Azure services (like App Service or Functions) to your Neon Postgres database.

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon Console**

  The **Computes** tab on individual branch pages in the Neon Console now shows **Started** and **Suspended** labels for the primary compute, indicating when the compute was last started or suspended.

- **Neon API**

  - We added a `started_at` attribute to the [Retrieve compute endpoint details](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getprojectendpoint) response. This timestamp shows when your Neon compute was last started. Since Neon computes pick up the latest available updates on restart, this information can help you track when [compute updates](/docs/manage/updates) were last applied.
 
- **Vercel Native Integration**

  New Neon projects (referred to as _Databases_ in Vercel) now use Postgres 17 by default. Previously, projects created through the [Vercel Native Integration](/docs/guides/vercel-native-integration) used Postgres 15.

- **Fixes**

  Fixed an issue that caused the **Tables** page in the Neon Console to reload when the browser tab regained focus.
