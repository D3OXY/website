## SÃ£o Paulo AWS region now generally available ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·

Neon is now generally available in AWS's SÃ£o Paulo region (`sa-east-1`). Create projects in the SÃ£o Paulo region for lower latency access from South America and to keep your data within Brazil.

## Manage your database from Cline or Windsurf

You can now manage your Neon database directly from Cline or Windsurf using natural language, made possible by the [Neon Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server](https://github.com/neondatabase/mcp-server-neon).

## Scheduled updates for Business plan accounts

A few weeks ago, we announced _scheduled updates_ for Neon, which include Postgres version upgrades, security patches, and Neon feature enhancements.

Updates only take a few seconds and are applied at the scheduled time or the next time your compute restarts.

Updates for Business plan accounts will start rolling out next week. You can check for updates notices and choose a preferred update window â€” [learn how](/docs/manage/updates#updates-on-paid-plans).

_Computes larger than 8 CU or configured to scale beyond 8 CU are not updated automatically._

For more information about updates, see our [Updates documentation](/docs/manage/updates). If you have questions, please reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/92vNTzKDGp) or [contact Neon Support](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=support).
