- **More local disk space for Neon computes**

  We increased the local disk space allocation for Neon computes, which will now receive 15 GiB x maximum vCPU setting with a minimum of 20 GiB. This change ensures optimal handling of temporary data, query operations, and maintenance tasks in Postgres.
