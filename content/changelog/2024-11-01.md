### Neon Authorize

Announced at our [Neon Deploy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDNsxw_3ris&t=289s) event earlier this week was **Neon Authorize**. This Neon feature integrates with third-party **JWT-based authentication providers** like Auth0 and Clerk, bringing authorization closer to your data by leveraging [Row-Level Security (RLS)](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-rowsecurity.html) at the database level.

### Build RAG pipelines with the `pgrag` extension

Also introduced at Neon Deploy, our new [pgrag](https://neon.tech/docs/extensions/pgrag) Postgres extension supports creating end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. No additional programming languages or libraries are required. With functions provided by `pgrag`, you can build a complete RAG pipeline from without leaving your SQL client.

### pg_mooncake support

We added support for [pg_mooncake](https://github.com/Mooncake-Labs/pg_mooncake), a new Postgres extension that adds native columnstore tables with DuckDB execution. [Read the blog post](https://mooncake.dev/blog/3) for more.

And don't forget to check out this week's fixes and improvements:

### Neon on Azure update

A few weeks ago we announced the Neon on Azure Beta and we invited everyone to try it out free of charge. The Beta period is coming to an end as of of Dec 1, 2024, and any Neon projects created on Azure by paid plan accounts will be come billable, meaning that storage and compute used by those projects will be counted toward your Neon plan allowances and any extra usage will incur charges. Projects created on the Free plan remain free. Thank you to all of our early Neon on Azure adopters. You've help us make Neon better. Stay tuned for news about Neon on Azure.

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon Console enhancement**

- **Neon API changes**

  We've introduced a new [Get active regions](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getactiveregions) endpoint for retrieving a list of regions supported by Neon. The response body includes data such as the region ID, name, and the region's approximate geographical latitude and longitude.

  ```bash
  curl --request GET \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/regions \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY'
  ```

- **Fixes**

- **Contact support form improvements**:

  You can now attach files along with your problem description when requesting help from Neon support. File size limit is 50 MB and we support the following file types:

  - PDF (. pdf)
  - PNG (. png)
  - JPEG (. jpeg)
  - GIF (. gif)
  - Text (. txt)

- **More local disk space for Neon computes**

  We increased the local disk space allocation for Neon computes, which will now receive 15 GiB x maximum vCPU setting with a minimum of 20 GiB. This change ensures optimal handling of temporary data, query operations, and maintenance tasks in Postgres.
