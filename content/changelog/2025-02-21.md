## Active Queries and Query History views open to all Neon users

The **Active Queries** and **Query History** views in the Neon Console are now open to all users. You can find them on the **Monitoring** page in your Neon project.

- The **Active Queries** view displays up to 100 currently running queries for the selected **Branch**, **Compute**, and **Database**.
- The **Query History** view shows the top 100 previously run queries for the selected **Branch**, **Compute**, and **Database**. Queries can be sorted by **Frequency** or **Average time**.

For more about these views, see [Monitor active queries](/docs/introduction/monitor-active-queries) and [Monitor query history](/docs/introduction/monitor-query-history).

## Private Networking now is GA

Neon' Private Networking feature, which enables secure database connections via AWS PrivateLink, is now GA. This feature keeps all traffic between your client application and Neon database within AWS's private network, bypassing the public internet.

This GA release includes Neon API and CLI support for setting up and managing Private Networking.

For details, see our guide: [Neon Private Networking](/docs/guides/neon-private-networking).

## Scheduled updates for Launch, Scale, and Business plans

A few weeks ago, we announced _scheduled updates_ for Neon, which include Postgres version upgrades, security patches, and Neon feature enhancements.

Updates, which take only a few seconds, are applied at the scheduled time or the next time your compute restarts.

Updates for Launch and Scale Plan users will start rolling next week. 

Business plan users can expect to see **update notices** next week. 
We aim to provide 7 days' notice for updates on paid plans.

You can check for updates notices and choose a preferred update window â€” [learn how](/docs/manage/updates#updates-on-paid-plans).

We also support checking for update notices and setting update windows programmatically using the [Neon API](/docs/manage/updates#check-for-updates-using-the-neon-api).

For more information about updates, see our [Updates documentation](/docs/manage/updates). If you have questions, please reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/92vNTzKDGp) or [contact Neon Support](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=support).

## Chat with Neon AI while you code

In case you missed the previous announcement, Neon now offers Copilot Chat extensions for [GitHub](https://github.com/marketplace/neon-database) and [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=buildwithlayer.neon-integration-expert-15j6N).

**Install them now:**

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon Console**
- **Go SDK - new version**

  A new version of the community-developed Go SDK (v0.13.0) has been released. Thank you to [@kislerdm](https://github.com/kislerdm) for his ongoing contributions.
- **Neon Postgres Previews Integration on Vercel**: 

    Preview deployments are no longer canceled if environment variables in Vercel are already set with the correct values. The first deployment of a branch is still canceled and recreated automatically, but subsequent deployments will proceed without interruption. 
    
    For users using the Vercel CLI, the first deployment for a new branch will be canceled, but retries will complete successfully.
