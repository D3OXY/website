### Postgres extension updates

- The `pgx_ulid` extension (0.2.0) is now available for Postgres 17. To install it, run:

  `CREATE EXTENSION pgx_ulid;`

  For Postgres 14, 15, and 16, the `pgx_ulid` extension has also been updated to version 0.2.0, but the installation command is different. Use:

  `CREATE EXTENSION ulid;`

- We now support installing the previous version of `pgvector`.

  ```sql
  CREATE EXTENSION vector VERSION '0.7.4';
  ```

  The currently supported `pgvector` version in Neon is `0.8.0`, with `0.7.4` being the previous version. Currently supported extension versions are listed on Neon's [Postgres extension page](/docs/extensions/extensions-intro).

- **Neon API**

  FF: We added a new endpoint for deploying a **Neon Identity** integration programmatically. Neon Identity lets you sync user profiles from your auth provider directly to your database. Join the Early Access Program to try it out. [Sign up here](https://neon.tech/early-access-program).

  Check out our [docs](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/neon-identity) to learn more.

  _Currently supporting Stack Auth, more providers coming soon._

  ```bash
  curl --request POST \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/identity/create \

     --header 'authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Drizzle Studio update**

  The Drizzle Studio integration that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console has been updated to version 1.0.11. For the latest improvements and fixes, see the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

- **Console updates**

- **Neon API**

  Neon API keys are now prefixed by `napi_`, as in the following example: `napi_<64-bit token>`. API key prefixes enable security measures that depend on identifiable markers.

- **Fixes**

  - **A new "Past invoices" drawer**. Past invoices are now accessible via **View past invoices** button at the top of the **Billing** page in the Neon Console. Clicking the button opens the **Past invoices** drawer.
