### The Neon Slack App is available for early access

![Neon Slack App](/docs/relnotes/slack_app.png)

The Neon Slack App helps you stay connected to your Neon Serverless Postgres databases. Hereâ€™s what you can do with it:

- ðŸ“ˆ Track compute and storage usage in real time
- ðŸ”” Receive alerts when your database approaches its performance limits
- ðŸŸ¢ Quickly verify the Neon platform's status

Weâ€™d love to hear your feedback. Use the `/neon feedback` command in Slack to share your thoughts and feature requests.

ðŸ‘‰ [Install Neon Slack App](https://slack.com/apps/A083ZAHGL1Z) or check out the [documentation](/docs/manage/slack-app) to get started.

### Neon Chat for Visual Studio Code

The [Neon Chat for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=buildwithlayer.neon-integration-expert-15j6N) extension is now available in the GitHub Marketplace. This AI-powered assistant lets you chat with the latest Neon documentation without leaving your IDE.

Get answers to common questions like:

- _How to create a project?_
- _How can I get started with the Neon API?_
- _How do create a branch using the Neon CLI?_

### Scheduled updates coming soon ðŸ“…

Neon is introducing scheduled updates, starting with Free Plan accounts and later expanding to Paid Plan accounts. These updates will cover Postgres updates, security patches, and Neon feature enhancements, automatically applied to your project's computes. Here's what to expect:

- Updates arenâ€™t new, but now theyâ€™ll be scheduled so youâ€™ll know when theyâ€™re coming and won't fall behind on important maintenance.
- Updates require a compute restart, but restarts are quick â€” taking just a few seconds.
- Youâ€™ll be able to track scheduled updates in your project settings.
- Free Plan accounts will have updates scheduled in advance for a specific day and time, while Paid Plan accounts will be able to choose a preferred update window.

Stay tuned for specific details about when scheduled updates will roll out. Free Plan users can expect to see scheduled updates first, starting in early February. Scheduled updates on Paid Plans will roll out later, with updates for large compute sizes (> 8 CU) rolling out last.

### Connect to external Postgres databases with `postgres_fdw` and `dblink`

Neon now supports accessing external Postgres databases using the `postgres_fdw` or `dblink` extensions.

- `dblink` lets you easily connect to other Postgres databases and run queries on them. It's a good choice for quick, one-off queries or situations where you need data from a remote database but donâ€™t want to configure a foreign data wrapper.
- `postgres_fdw` (foreign data wrapper) is built for more robust and integrated access to remote Postgres databases. It allows you to define foreign tables that map to tables in another database, making it possible to query remote data as though it were stored locally.

These extensions are available only on paid Neon plans. To enable either extension, [open a support ticket](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=support) and include your endpoint ID and the database name where you'd like the extension enabled.

### Support for the `pg_repack` extension

The Postgres `pg_repack` extension is now available on paid Neon plans upon request. This extension helps you remove bloat from tables and indexes while optionally restoring the physical order of clustered indexes â€” all without requiring an exclusive lock during processing. To enable `pg_repack`, [open a support ticket](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=support) and include your endpoint ID and the database name where you'd like the extension enabled.

### Meet "Instagres": No signup, instant Postgres âœ¨ 

Neon's architecture let's us do some pretty interesting things, like creating a Postgres database in less than a second (AI agents loves this, btw). To showcase this ability, we've built "Instagres," an app that lets you generate a Postgres database URL almost instantly â€” no sign up required. If you'd like to keep the database for more than an hour, you can transfer it to your Neon account.

![Instagres UI](/docs/relnotes/instagres.png)

Give it a try at [https://www.instagres.com/](https://www.instagres.com/) or by running `npx instagres` in your terminal.

The "Instagres" app is powered by @Cloudflare, React Router, and @DrizzleORM.

If you like this feature or see different use cases for it, please let us know via the [Feedback](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=feedback) form in the Neon Console or our [feedback channel](https://discord.com/channels/1176467419317940276/1176788564890112042) on Discord.

### Pooled connection strings are now default in the Neon Console

[Pooled connection strings](/docs/connect/connection-pooling) are now the default in the **Connection Details** widget and **Quickstart** in the Neon Console. Pooled connection strings include include a `-pooler` option, which directs connections to a pooled connection port, powered by PgBouncer. With support for up to 10,000 concurrent connections, connection pooling improves performance, reduces latency, and makes resource management more efficient for most applications. For specific tasks like `pg_dump` and other session-dependent operations like schema migrations, you can still get direct connection string at any time by disabling the connection pooling toggle in the **Connection Details** widget or by removing `-pooler` from your connection string manually.

<details>

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Drizzle Studio update**

  The Drizzle Studio integration that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console has been updated to version 1.0.11. For the latest improvements and fixes, see the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

- **Console updates**

  **Increased concurrency limits**. Last week we announced increased Neon API operation concurrency limits on Neon's Free, Launch, and Scale plans. **This enhancement is now supported on all Neon plans**.

  As noted in last week's changelog: Previously, concurrent API operations within a Neon project â€” such as operations on different branches â€” could trigger a "project already has running operations" error, where one branch operation would block others. This improvement reduces the need to work around strict concurrency limits. However, we still recommend adding retry functionality to handle rare cases where an API operation fails due to ongoing operations.

  This change applies only to the Neon API. In the Neon Console, controls such as buttons that initiate new operations are still briefly disabled until ongoing operations are complete. Concurrency improvements will be reflected in the UI in a future release.

- **Fixes**

  Fixed an issue with the **Create branch** button in the Neon Console. Previously, the button became disabled for unfinished project operations, including those that failed due to an error. Now, the button is disabled only for project operations in the canceling, running, or scheduling state.
