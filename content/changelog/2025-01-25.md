### Support for the `pg_repack` extension

The Postgres `pg_repack` extension is now available on paid Neon plans upon request. This extension helps you remove bloat from tables and indexes while optionally restoring the physical order of clustered indexes — all without requiring an exclusive lock during processing. To enable `pg_repack`, [open a support ticket](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=support) and include your endpoint ID and the database name where you'd like the extension enabled.

### Scheduled updates for Free Plan accounts coming soon

Neon will soon introduce scheduled updates for Free Plan accounts. These updates will include Postgres updates, security patches, and Neon feature enhancements, automatically applied to your project's computes. Here's what you need to know:

- Updates aren't new — the change is that they'll now be scheduled so you know when they're coming.
- Updates involve a compute restart, but the process only takes a few seconds — as it always has.
- You’ll be able to monitor scheduled updates in your project settings.
- Updates will be scheduled for a specific day and time

Stay tuned for more details about when scheduled updates will roll out.

- **Drizzle Studio update**

  The Drizzle Studio integration that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console has been updated. For the latest improvements and fixes, see the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

- **Console updates**

  - **Increased concurrency limits**. Last week we announced increased Neon API operation concurrency limits on Neon's Free, Launch, and Scale plans. **This enhancement is now supported on all Neon plans**. Previously, concurrent API operations within a Neon project — such as operations on different branches — could trigger a "project already has running operations" error, where one branch operation would block others. This improvement reduces the need to work around strict concurrency limits. However, we still recommend adding retry functionality to handle rare cases where an API operation fails due to ongoing operations.

    This change applies only to the Neon API. In the Neon Console, controls such as buttons that initiate new operations are still briefly disabled until ongoing operations are complete. Concurrency improvements will be reflected in the UI in a future release.
