### Neon Copilot Extension

The [Neon Database Copilot Extension](https://github.com/marketplace/neon-database) is now available in the GitHub Marketplace. This extension makes it easier to configure Neon for your repository by providing chat-based access to the latest Neon documentation with repository context.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'left' }}>
  <img 
    src="/docs/relnotes/github_copilot_extension.png" 
    alt="Neon GitHub copilot extension" 
    style={{ width: '486px', height: '96px' }} 
  />
</div>

Chat with curated Neon database documentation directly in GitHub Copilot and get answers to common questions like:

- _How to create a project?_
- _How can I get started with the Neon API?_
- _Integrate the Neon API into my GitHub repository._

Coming soon, you'll be able to directly interact with Neon endpoints by simply asking questions. Additionally, new tools will enable you to create Neon databases directly from the chat interface.

### Added support for the `pg_repack` extension

The `pg_repack` extension is now available in Neon. This extension helps remove bloat from tables and indexes while optionally restoring the physical order of clustered indexes â€” all without requiring an exclusive lock during processing.

For usage details, refer to the [pg_repack documentation](https://reorg.github.io/pg_repack/).

### Schema Diff API

Already announced but not in the changelog, Neon now supports a schema diff API.

**Setup Instructions:**

1. Install the extension.
2. Type `@neondatabase` in the chat to start interacting (participant setup may take a few minutes).

- **Drizzle Studio update**

  The Drizzle Studio integration that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console has been updated. For the latest improvements and fixes, see the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

- **Console updates**

  - Added a new [List running operations](tbd) endpoint, which retrieves a list of all running operations for the specified Neon project.

  The Neon CLI now creates projects with Postgres 17 by default.
