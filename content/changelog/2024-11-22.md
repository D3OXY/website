description: Org API keys, a new Python SDK, and more

## Org API keys

Neon now supports API keys for [Organizations](https://neon.tech/docs/manage/organizations). As an admin of an organization, you control your organization's API keys. These keys provide admin-level access to all organization resources, including projects, members, and billing information.

You can access your organization's API keys from your organization settings.

## A new Python SDK for the Neon API

Neon now supports [Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/neon-api/), which is a wrapper for the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api). This SDK simplifies integration of Python applications with the Neon platform, providing methods to programmatically manage API keys, projects, branches, databases, endpoints, roles, and operations.

Install with `pip`:

```bash
$ pip install neon-api
```

To get started, see [Python SDK for the Neon API](https://neon.tech/docs/reference/python-sdk).

<Admonition type="tip" title="Did you know?">
In addition to the new Python SDK, Neon offers a TypeScript SDK for the Neon API. There are also community-maintained SDKs available for Go and Node.js. [Learn more](https://neon.tech/docs/reference/sdk).

## `timescaledb` extension support for Postgres 17

We added support the `timescaledb` extension, version 2.17.1, to Postgres 17.

For a complete list of Postgres extensions supported by Neon, see [Postgres extensions](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions).

And don't forget to check out this week's fixes and improvements:

<details>

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **IP Allow**

  We addressed an issue for IP Allow users connecting over VPN where an **Access Denied** modal appeared repeatedly on the **SQL Editor** and **Tables** pages in the Neon Console. To prevent this, we added a "Do not ask again" checkbox to allow users to silence the modal.

- **Time Travel Assist**

  Ephemeral compute timeouts for [Time Travel Assist](/docs/guides/time-travel-assist) have been increased from 10 to 30 seconds. Time Travel Assist enables querying any point in your history using temporary branches and computes, which are automatically cleaned up after use. After 30 seconds of inactivity, the branch is deleted, and the endpoint is removed.

- **Neon API updates**

  We added two new endpoints for managing Neon [Organization](https://neon.tech/docs/manage/organizations) members:

  - [Update the role for an organization member](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/updateorganizationmember)
  - [Remove member from the organization](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/removeorganizationmember)
