## A new Python SDK for the Neon API

Neon now supports the [neon-api Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/neon-api/), a wrapper for the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api). This SDK simplifies integration of Python applications with the Neon platform, providing methods to programmatically manage API keys, Neon projects, branches, databases, endpoints, roles, and operations.

## Postgres version updates

We updated supported Postgres versions to [14.15](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/14.14/), [15.10](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/15.9/), [16.6](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/16.5/), and [17.2](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/17.1/), respectively.

When a new minor version is available on Neon, it is applied the next time your compute restarts (for any reason). For more about how we handle Postgres version upgrades, refer to our [Postgres version support policy](/docs/postgresql/postgres-version-policy).

And don't forget to check out this week's fixes and improvements:

## Postgres extension update

We added support the `timescaledb` extension to Postgres 17.
