### Neon Organizations now GA! ðŸŽ‰

We're happy to announce that Neon **Organizations** is now **generally available** for all everyone looking to move their teams to Neon.

![get started with your new org](/docs/manage/org_projects.png)

Create a new organization, transfer over your projects, invite your team members and get started collaborating. The Organizations feature lets you manage all of your team's projects under a single account â€” with billing, role management, and project transfer capabilities in one accessible location.

See [Neon Organizations](/docs/manage/organizations) to get started. Organizations is a paid account feature.

### Branches page table sorting!

You can now sort the branches table on the **Branches** page by any field, including **parent**, **data size**, **active hours**, and **created by**. It works on protected branches too.

We also added quick compute size editing directly from the primary branch column â€” just click the size link to adjust your settings.

And don't forget to check out this week's fixes and improvements:

<details>

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- We've added .NET to the list of supported connection strings for various languages and frameworks in the Dashboard. You can now find connection details for .NET in both the connection widget and the Quickstart.

  For more information on connecting to Neon with .NET, see [Connect a .NET (C#) application to Neon](/docs/guides/dotnet-npgsql).

- We've modified our autoscaling range slider to better handle larger compute sizes and added a constraint: your maximum range can be no more than 8x your minimum.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center'}}>
  <img src="/docs/relnotes/autoscaling_ratio.png" alt="autoscaling slider showing ratio limit of 8x min" style={{ width: '60%', maxWidth: '600px', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

- We've added a **Monitor** button to each listed endpoint on your Branch details page. Click the button to open the **Monitoring** page, displaying metrics for this endpoint.

- **Vercel-managed organizations updates**

  We've updated the Neon Console interface to better handle Vercel-managed projects:

  - Project compute settings can only be modified through Vercel
  - Deleting the read-write compute on the root branch is not available for Vercel-managed projects

- **Fixes**

  - Improved validation of API key names:added length limits to the API specification and improved whitespace handling in the UI.
  - The Create Organization modal now correctly displays your Personal account plan when creating a new organization. Previously, it sometimes showed the plan from an existing organization instead.
  - When transferring a project to an organization, collaborators who are organization members are automatically removed from the project's collaborator list, as they already have access through their organization membership
  - Fixed billing page display issues with project limits and usage tracking during plan changes. Previously, some organizations saw incorrect counts and misaligned indicators.
  - Added length validation for Organizationmember email addresses to prevent submission of invalid values.

- **Vercel Integration updates**

  We've updated the Neon Console to better handle projects in the Vercel integration:

  - Project compute settings can only be modified through Vercel
  - Deleting the read-write compute on the root branch is not available for Vercel projects
