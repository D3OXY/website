## pg_search is now available on Neon

We’ve partnered with [ParadeDB](https://www.paradedb.com/) to bring `pg_search` to all Neon, delivering up to 1,000x faster full-text search inside Postgres. The `pg_search` extension introduces Elasticsearch-grade ranking, typo tolerance, faceted search, and JSON-aware filtering—all within Postgres. Powered by a BM25-based inverted index, `pg_search` outperforms native Postgres FTS (`tsvector`/`tsquery`), making it ideal for search-heavy applications. It’s available now for Neon databases running Postgres 17 on AWS. To get started, check out our [pg_search docs](https://neon.tech/docs/extensions/pg_search).

Description of Feature B

<details>

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon Console**

  - Expanded the database drop-down menu width in the Neon SQL Editor to accommodate longer database names. Previously, longer names were not fully visible due to the narrow menu width.
  - Added an `Unable to fetch projects` message to the Projects page in the Neon Console. Previously, an error page was displayed when the project list couldn't be retrieved.

- **Neon API**

  - Improved performance of the [Compare database schema](/reference/getprojectbranchschemacomparison) endpoint by retrieving schemas in parallel.
  - The `name` field for branches is now limited to 256 characters in the [Create project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createproject) and [Create branch](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectbranch) endpoints.


- **Neon CLI**
