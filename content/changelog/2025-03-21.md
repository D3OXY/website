## pg_search is now available on Neon

We’ve partnered with [ParadeDB](https://www.paradedb.com/) to bring `pg_search` to all Neon, delivering up to 1,000x faster full-text search inside Postgres. The `pg_search` extension introduces Elasticsearch-grade ranking, typo tolerance, faceted search, and JSON-aware filtering—all within Postgres. Powered by a BM25-based inverted index, `pg_search` outperforms native Postgres FTS (`tsvector`/`tsquery`), making it ideal for search-heavy applications. It’s available now for Neon databases running Postgres 17 on AWS. To get started, check out our [pg_search docs](https://neon.tech/docs/extensions/pg_search).
