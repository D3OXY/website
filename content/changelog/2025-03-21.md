title: Search faster with pg_search, Neon is now MACC-eligible on Azure, and more

## Search faster with `pg_search` on Neon

We’ve partnered with [ParadeDB](https://www.paradedb.com/) to bring `pg_search` to all Neon, delivering up to 1,000x faster full-text search inside Postgres. The `pg_search` extension introduces Elasticsearch-grade ranking, typo tolerance, faceted search, and JSON-aware filtering—all within Postgres. Powered by a BM25-based inverted index, `pg_search` outperforms native Postgres FTS (`tsvector`/`tsquery`), making it ideal for search-heavy applications. It’s available now for Neon databases running Postgres 17 on AWS. To get started, check out our [pg_search docs](https://neon.tech/docs/extensions/pg_search).

## Neon Postgres spend on Azure is now counted toward your MACC

Neon Postgres purchases made through the Azure Marketplace is now counted toward your Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment (MACC). As an Azure Benefit Eligible partner, any spend on Neon Postgres via the marketplace helps fulfill your committed Azure spend with no extra steps required.

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon Console**

  - Expanded the database drop-down menu width in the Neon SQL Editor to accommodate longer database names. Previously, longer names were not fully visible due to the narrow menu width.
  - Added an `Unable to fetch projects` message to the Projects page in the Neon Console. Previously, an error page was displayed when the project list couldn't be retrieved.

- **Autoscaling default settings for newly created projects**

    We've updated the default autoscaling settings for newly created projects to provide a better balance of performance and efficiency on paid plans:

    | **Neon plan**  | **Minimum compute size** | **Maximum compute size** |
    |---------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
    | Launch        | 1                    | 4                     |
    | Scale         | 1                    | 8                     |
    | Business      | 1                    | 8                     |

    These optimized defaults help ensure projects scale smoothly to meet workload demands while maintaining cost efficiency. This change applies only to newly created projects—existing projects and computes remain unaffected. You can review and adjust your autoscaling settings anytime in your project settings. From your **Project Dashboard**, go to **Settings** > **Compute**.

- **Postgres `effective_cache_size` setting is now optimized for better query plans**

    Previously, Neon didn’t explicitly set the Postgres `effective_cache_size` Postgres parameter, so it defaulted to 4 GiB—often too low for larger compute sizes and autoscaling configurations. We now set this value based on the maximum size of the Local File Cache (LFC) for a compute's maximum compute size, which helps the Postgres query planner make better decisions and improves query performance.

- **Neon API**

  - Improved performance of the [Compare database schema](/reference/getprojectbranchschemacomparison) endpoint by retrieving schemas in parallel.
  - The `name` field for branches is now limited to 256 characters in the [Create project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createproject) and [Create branch](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectbranch) endpoints.
  - Added a new [List shared preloaded libraries](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getavailablepreloadlibraries) endpoint. Some Postgres extensions require libraries that must be preloaded when a compute restarts. This endpoint lists extensions with preloaded libraries and whether the libraries are preloaded by default. In addition, the [Create project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createproject) and [Update project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/updateproject) endpoints now support a `preload_libraries` object where you can specify the shared libraries to preload in your project's computes. The [Retrieve project details](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getproject) modal also includes a `preload_libraries` object in its response body.

- **Drizzle Studio update**

    We updated the Drizzle Studio integration that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console to version 1.0.18. For the latest improvements and fixes, see the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

- **Fixes**

  - Resolved an issue where resetting a role password in the Neon Console would result in an "invalid password" error in the **SQL Editor** and on the **Tables** page. Now, the correct credentials are applied automatically, ensuring continued access.
  - Revised the copy at the bottom of the **Connect to your database** modal for older Neon projects. The copy previously mentioned that passwords are stored, which is only true for Neon projects created after password storage was introduced.
