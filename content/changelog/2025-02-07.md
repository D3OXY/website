### Added support for the `pg_repack` extension

The `pg_repack` extension is now available in Neon. This extension helps remove bloat from tables and indexes while optionally restoring the physical order of clustered indexes — all without requiring an exclusive lock during processing.

For usage details, refer to the [pg_repack documentation](https://reorg.github.io/pg_repack/).

- **Rate limiting for Neon public API**. To ensure stability and fair usage, we’ve introduced per-project rate limits to the Neon public API. This change helps prevent accidental overloads or excessive API calls that could disrupt service for other users. While most users won’t notice a difference, if your project exceeds the limit you'll receive clear error messages with retry details.

- **Neon API**

  FF: We added a new endpoint for deploying a **Neon Identity** integration programmatically. Neon Identity lets you sync user profiles from your auth provider directly to your database. Join the Early Access Program to try it out. [Sign up here](https://neon.tech/early-access-program).

  Check out our [docs](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/neon-identity) to learn more.
