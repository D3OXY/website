Use Clerk with Neon Authorize to add secure, database-level authorization to your application. This guide assumes you already have an application using Clerk for user authentication. It shows you how to integrate Clerk with Neon Authorize, then provides sample Row-level Security (RLS) policies to help you model your own application schema.

## How it works

Clerk handles user authentication by generating JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which are securely passed to Neon Authorize. Neon Authorize validates these tokens and uses the embedded user identity metadata to enforce the [Row-Level Security](https://neon.tech/postgresql/postgresql-administration/postgresql-row-level-security) policies that you define directly in Postgres, securing database queries based on that user identity.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this guide, you will need:

- A Neon account. If you do not have one, sign up at [Neon](https://neon.tech). Create your first project in **AWS**. [Azure](/docs/guides/neon-authorize#current-limitations) regions are not currently supported.
- A [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) account and an existing application that uses Clerk for user authentication. Clerk offers a free plan to help you get started.
- An existing application (for example, a **todos** app) where you can model your RLS policies on the samples in this guide. If you don't have an app, refer to our [demo](https://github.com/neondatabase-labs/clerk-nextjs-neon-authorize) to see similar schema and policies in action.

## Integrate Clerk with Neon Authorize

In this first set of steps, we’ll integrate Clerk as an authorization provider in Neon. When these steps are complete, Clerk will start passing JWTs to your Neon database, which you can then use to create policies.

### 1. Get your Clerk JWKS URL

For a basic integration, the default JWT claims from Clerk, including the `user_id`, are all you need for Neon Authorize. Use the following JWKS URL format:

```bash
https://{yourClerkDomain}/.well-known/jwks.json
```

You can find your JWKS URL in the Clerk Dashboard under **Configure → Developers → API Keys**. Click **Show JWT Public Key** and copy the JWKS URL for later.

For advanced JWT configuration, such as adding claims or setting token lifespans, create a blank JWT template in **Configure > JWT Templates**. A dedicated Neon template is coming soon.

### 2. Add Clerk as an authorization provider in the Neon Console

Once you have the JWKS URL, go to the **Neon Console** and add Clerk as an authentication provider under the **Authorize** page. Paste your copied URL and Clerk will be automatically recognized and selected.

![Add Authentication Provider](/docs/guides/clerk_jwks_url_in_neon.png)

At this point, you can use the **Get Started** setup steps from the Authorize page in Neon to complete the setup — this guide is modelled on those steps. Or feel free to keep following along in this guide, where we'll give you a bit more context.

### 3. Install the pg_session_jwt extension in your database

Neon Authorize uses the [pg_session_jwt](https://github.com/neondatabase/pg_session_jwt) extension to handle authenticated sessions through JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). This extension allows secure transmission of authentication data from your application to Postgres, where you can enforce Row-Level Security (RLS) policies based on the user's identity.

When installed, the `pg_session_jwt` enables passwordless connections by using JWTs for user authentication. Two roles are created for you: `authenticated` and `anonymous`.

To install the extension in the `neondb` database, run:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_session_jwt;
```

<Admonition type="note">
In a future update, setting up the `pg_session_jwt` extension and granting role privileges will be done automatically when you add an authentication provider to your Neon project.
</Admonition>

### 4. Set up Roles

Next, define the table-level permissions for these new roles. For most use cases of Neon Authorize, you should run the following commands in order to give the roles access to read and write to any table in your public schema:

```sql
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO authenticated;
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO anonymous;
```

Later, you can define RLS policies that will restrict what your application's users can do with these roles.

### 5. Install the Neon Serverless Driver

Neon’s Serverless Driver manages the connection between your application and the Neon Postgres database. It supports HTTP, WebSockets, and TCP connections. For Neon Authorize, the connection must be established over HTTP. For HTTP, we recommend using this driver.

Install it using the following command:

```bash
npm install @neondatabase/serverless
```

To learn more about the driver, see [Neon Serverless Driver](/docs/serverless/serverless-driver).

### 6. Set up environment variables

Copy the `authenticated` role connection string into your `.env` file. You can find it from **Connection Details** in the Neon Console, or using the Neon CLI:

```bash
neonctl connection-string --role-name authenticated
```

Add this to your `.env` file.

```bash shouldWrap
# Neon "authenticated" role connection string
DATABASE_AUTHENTICATED_URL='postgresql://authenticated@random-host-12345.eastus2.azure.neon.build/random-db?sslmode=require'
```

## Add RLS policies

At this point, Clerk is now fully integrated with Neon Authorize. JWTs are now passed securely to your Neon database. You can now start adding RLS policies to your schema and running authenticated queries from your application.

### 1. Add Row-Level Security policies

Below are examples of RLS policies for a **todos** table, designed to restrict access so that users can only create, view, update, or delete their own todos.

<Tabs labels={["SQL","Drizzle"]}>

<TabItem>

```sql
-- schema for TODOs table
CREATE TABLE todos (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  user_id text not null default (auth.user_id()),
  task text,
  is_complete boolean default false,
  inserted_at timestamp not null
);

-- 1st enable row level security for your table
alter table todos enable row level security;

-- 2nd create policies for your table
create policy "Individuals can create todos." on todos for
  insert with check (auth.user_id() = user_id);

create policy "Individuals can view their own todos." on todos for
  select using (auth.user_id() = user_id);

create policy "Individuals can update their own todos." on todos for
  update using (auth.user_id() = user_id);

create policy "Individuals can delete their own todos." on todos for
  delete using (auth.user_id() = user_id);
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

```typescript
import { InferSelectModel, sql } from 'drizzle-orm';
import { bigint, boolean, pgPolicy, pgTable, text, timestamp } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';

// schema for TODOs table
export const todos = pgTable(
  'todos',
  {
    id: bigint('id', { mode: 'bigint' }).primaryKey().generatedByDefaultAsIdentity(),
    userId: text('user_id')
      .notNull()
      .default(sql`(auth.user_id())`),
    task: text('task').notNull(),
    isComplete: boolean('is_complete').notNull().default(false),
    insertedAt: timestamp('inserted_at', { withTimezone: true }).defaultNow().notNull(),
  },
  // Create policies for your table
  (t) => ({
    p1: pgPolicy('create todos', {
      for: 'insert',
      to: 'authenticated',
      withCheck: sql`(select auth.user_id() = user_id)`,
    }),

    p2: pgPolicy('view todos', {
      for: 'select',
      to: 'authenticated',
      using: sql`(select auth.user_id() = user_id)`,
    }),

    p3: pgPolicy('update todos', {
      for: 'update',
      to: 'authenticated',
      using: sql`(select auth.user_id() = user_id)`,
    }),

    p4: pgPolicy('delete todos', {
      for: 'delete',
      to: 'authenticated',
      using: sql`(select auth.user_id() = user_id)`,
    }),
  })
);

export type Todo = InferSelectModel<typeof todos>;
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 2. Run your first authorized query

With RLS policies in place, you can now query the database using JWTs from Clerk, restricting access based on the user's identity. Here are examples of how you could run authenticated queries from both the backend and the frontend of our sample **todos** application.

<TabItem>

```tsx shouldWrap
'use server';

import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server';

export async function TodoList() {
  const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_AUTHENTICATED_URL!, {
    authToken: async () => {
      const token = await auth().getToken();
      if (!token) {
        throw new Error('No token');
      }
      return token;
    },
  });

  // WHERE filter is optional because of RLS.
  // But we send it anyway for performance reasons.
  const todos = await sql('select * from todos where user_id = auth.user_id()');

  return (
    <ul>
      {todos.map((todo) => (
        <li key={todo.id}>{todo.task}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

</TabItem>

```typescript shouldWrap
'use client';

  import type { Todo } from '@/app/schema';
  import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
  import { useAuth } from '@clerk/nextjs';
  import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

  const getDb = (token: string) =>
      neon(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DATABASE_AUTHENTICATED_URL!, {
          authToken: token,
      });

  export function TodoList() {
      const { getToken } = useAuth();
      const [todos, setTodos] = useState<Array<Todo>>();

      useEffect(() => {
          async function loadTodos() {
              const authToken = await getToken();

              if (!authToken) {
                  return;
              }

              const sql = getDb(authToken);

              // WHERE filter is optional because of RLS.
              // But we send it anyway for performance reasons.
              const todosResponse = await
                  sql('select * from todos where user_id = auth.user_id()');

              setTodos(todosResponse as Array<Todo>);
          }

          loadTodos();
      }, [getToken]);

      return (
          <ul>
              {todos?.map((todo) => (
                  <li key={todo.id}>
                      {todo.task}
                  </li>
              ))}
          </ul>
      );
  }
```
