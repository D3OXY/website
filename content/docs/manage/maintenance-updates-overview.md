Neon performs two types of system updates: **platform maintenance** and **compute updates**. While both are essential for maintaining a stable, secure, and optimized environment, they serve different purposes.

- **Platform maintenance** involves updates to Neon's infrastructure, including resource management, security patches, and system upgrades. These changes ensure platform stability and security. To learn more, see [Platform maintenance](/docs/manage/platform-maintenance).

- **Compute updates** apply improvements and updates to individual Neon computes, including Postgres updates, operating system patches, and new Neon features. These updates keep your Neon compute environment and Postgres instances current and optimized. To learn more, see [Updates](/docs/manage/updates).

For both types of updates, we strive to minimize disruptions through advanced notification and scheduling. The table below outlines where to look for update notices so that you stay on top of updates to the Neon platform and your project's computes.

### Where to check for maintenance and updates

| Type                     | Where to check                                         | Details                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| **Platform maintenance** | [Neon Status](https://neonstatus.com/)                 | Check the regional status page where your Neon compute resides for maintenance notices. Optionally, subscribe for updates. See [Neon Status](/docs/introduction/status) for more details. |
| **Compute updates**      | [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) | In the Neon project dashboard, go to **Settings** > **Updates** to view your update window and check for update notices. Paid plans allow you to select a preferred update window.        |
