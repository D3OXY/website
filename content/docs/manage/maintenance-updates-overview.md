Neon performs two types of system changes: **platform maintenance** and **scheduled compute updates**. While both are essential for maintaining a stable and secure environment, they serve different purposes.

- **Platform maintenance** involves updates to Neon's infrastructure, including resource management, security patches, and system upgrades. These changes ensure platform stability and security.

- **Scheduled compute updates** apply improvements and updates to individual Neon computes, including Postgres updates, OS patches, and new features. These updates keep your Neon compute environment and Postgres instances current and optimized.

Both types of changes can result in temporary disruptions, but we strive to minimize their impact through careful scheduling and advanced notification. Understanding how each works and where to look for maintenance and update notifications helps you plan for and accommodate these necessary changes.
