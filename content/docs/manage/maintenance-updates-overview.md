Neon performs two types of system update: **platform maintenance** and **scheduled compute updates**. While both are essential for maintaining a stable, secure, and optimized environment, they serve different purposes.

- **Platform maintenance** involves updates to Neon's infrastructure, including resource management, security patches, and system upgrades. These changes ensure platform stability and security.

- **Scheduled compute updates** apply improvements and updates to individual Neon computes, including Postgres updates, OS patches, and new Neon features. These updates keep your Neon compute environment and Postgres instances current and optimized.

Both types of update can result in minor disruptions, but we strive to minimize their impact through advanced notification for platform maintenance and scheduled update windows for compute updates. Understanding how each works and where to look for update notifications will help you plan for and accommodate these necessary changes.
