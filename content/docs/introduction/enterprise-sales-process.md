Our goal at Neon is to make the sales process as easy and efficient as possible. Below, we've outlined what our typical process looks like so you'll know what to expect when you reach out to us. Depending on your needs, additional discussions and consultations may be required. We'll be happy to arrange those as needed.

<Steps>

## Reach out to us

Start by filling out our [contact form](https://neon.tech/contact-sales) to let us know how we can help. If you’re looking for specific plans or pricing, sharing details about your feature requirements and workload will get the ball rolling immediately and speed up the overall process.

## Understanding your needs

After contacting us, we'll reach out by email to gather more information about your requirements. We'll ask you for information about:

- Your current database environment, such as the number of databases, regions, your application stack, and integrations with other tools, platforms, and services 
- Your workload, feature, and performance requirements
- Security and compliance requirements
- Your desired outcome and timeline

We may also ask you to run our [pg-prechecks script](https://github.com/neondatabase-labs/pg-prechecks) to gather details about your Postgres server and send the results back to the Neon solutions team.

<Admonition type="note" title="about pg-prechecks">
The `pg-prechecks` script provides a summary of a Postgres database server’s status and configuration, providing an overview at a glance. It also allows you to share relevant details with Neon. `pg-prechecks` is a heavily modified version of `pt-pg-summary`, which is part of the Percona Toolkit. Learn more about this tool, refer to the [pg-prechecks README](https://github.com/neondatabase-labs/pg-prechecks?tab=readme-ov-file#pg-prechecks).

These details help us understand your needs and prepare plan and pricing proposals.

## Call with the Neon solutions team

If an Enterprise plan is a good fit for your use case, our solutions team will set up a call to discuss:

- Configuration options and timelines
- Add-ons like support packages or custom requirements
- Any other questions you might have

Optionally, we can provide a demo or schedule a follow-up call if you’re interested in learning more about specific features.

_Our solutions team is made up of experience technical staff who have worked through migrations with some of our largest customers._

## Pricing and migration proposal

Based on our discussions, we’ll create a pricing proposal, often including a proof-of-concept migration plan. The proposal will be tailored using:

- Information from our initial conversation
- Your environment details
- Your workload, feature, and performance requirements

We’ll send the pricing proposal and migration plan and arrange a follow-up call to go through the , answer any questions you may have, and set out timelines should you decide to move forward.

## Stakeholder collaboration

At any time during the process, we’ll be happy to support your security team or other stakeholders by:

- Answering security-related questions
- Providing documentation
- Participating in reviews as needed

</Steps>

We’ve laid out our typical process above, but we're flexible and ready to adjust the process to fit your specific needs. [Reach out to us](https://neon.tech/contact-sales) to get started.
