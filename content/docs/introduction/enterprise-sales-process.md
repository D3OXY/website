## Neon Postgres sales process

We know your time is and valuable. For this reason, we aim to make our sales process as easy and efficient as possible, so you know exactly what to expect. Here's an overview of the steps that typically involved. Depending on your requirements, there may be additional discussions, and we're always ready to set aside more more time to work through all of your questions and requirements.

---

### 1. Reach out

Start by filling out our [contact form](https://neon.tech/contact-sales) to let us know what type of plan you're interested in. If you’re looking for pricing, providing detailed information about your workload can speed up the process. This step is optional but recommended.

---

### 2. Information gathering
We'll follow up via email to learn more about your workload and application requirements. This may include:

- Filling out our technical questionnaire
- Providing slow query log results (if applicable)

This helps us understand your current setup and prepare pricing details tailored to your application needs.

---

### 3. A call with out Solutions team
If our solutions engineering team identifies an Enterprise plan as the best fit for your use case, we'll schedule a call to discuss:

- Timelines and configurations
- Add-on options (e.g., support packages, sharding)
- Any other questions you may have

We can also provide a short demo or schedule a follow-up demo for specific features of interest.

---

### 4. Pricing proposal
In many cases, we can provide a pricing proposal after the first call. Our proposals are based on:

- The information shared in the initial call
- Technical questionnaire answers
- Your workload details

If requested, we can include a proof-of-concept (PoC) commitment with an opt-out period. Once the proposal is ready, we’ll send it to you and schedule a follow-up call if needed.

---

### 5. Additional details
If your environment is complex (e.g., multiple databases or custom configurations), we may request additional information, such as:

- An itemized bill from your current provider
- Specific details about your infrastructure

This helps us provide the most accurate pricing estimate.

---

### 6. Stakeholder support
Your security team or other stakeholders might have questions about the platform. We're happy to:

- Answer questions directly
- Complete security questionnaires
- Provide additional documentation as needed

---

### 7. Proof of concept (PoC)
If you choose to proceed with a PoC, we’ll create a shared Slack channel and collaborate to:

- Spin up and optimize your test workload
- Benchmark performance based on success criteria
- Provide ongoing support throughout the PoC phase

The PoC phase typically lasts 30 to 90 days, including an opt-out period. If the success criteria are met early, we can seamlessly transition to the full workload migration.
