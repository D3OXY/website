Our goal at Neon is to make the sales process straightforward and efficient. Here’s what to expect when you reach out to our team. Depending on your needs, there might be additional discussions, but we’re always open to scheduling extra time to address your questions.

<Steps>

## Contact us

Start by filling out our [contact form](https://neon.tech/contact-sales) to let us know how we can assist you. If you’re looking for specific plans or pricing, sharing details about your feature requirements and workload is optional but helpful in speeding up the process.

## Understanding your needs

We’ll reach out to gather more information about your requirements, including:

- Your current environment and setup
- Workload, feature, and performance needs

This helps us understand your needs and prepare relevant plan and pricing details.

## Call with the Neon solutions team

If an Enterprise plan is a good fit for your use case, we’ll set up a call to discuss:

- Configuration options and timelines
- Add-ons like support packages or custom requirements
- Any other questions you have

We can provide a demo or schedule a follow-up demo if you’re interested in specific features.

## Pricing and migration proposal

Based on our discussions, we’ll create a pricing proposal, often including a proof-of-concept migration plan. The proposal is tailored using:

- Information from our initial conversation
- Your environment details
- Your workload and performance requirements

We’ll send the proposal and arrange a follow-up call if needed.

## Additional information

If you have a more complex setup (e.g., multiple databases or special configurations), we might ask for additional details, such as:

- Current billing details
- Performance metrics
- Infrastructure specifics

This helps us provide accurate pricing and recommendations.

## Stakeholder collaboration

We’re happy to support your security team or other stakeholders by:

- Answering security-related questions
- Providing necessary documentation
- Participating in reviews as needed

We’re flexible and ready to adapt our process to fit your needs. [Reach out to us](https://neon.tech/contact-sales) to get started.
