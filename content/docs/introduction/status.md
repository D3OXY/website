To stay informed about Neon's status, we provide a dedicated status page for each region that Neon supports.

![Neon status page](/docs/introduction/neon_status_page.png)

You'll want to monitor the status page for the region where you created your Neon project. You can find your Neon project's region in the Neon Console.

Status pages provide status for:

- Database Connectivity
- Database Operations
- Console and API Requests

<Admonition type="note" title="platform maintenance notices">
You can also monitor your region's status page for upcoming [platform maintenance](/docs/manage/platform-maintenance).
</Admonition>

To view the Neon Status page, navigate to [https://neonstatus.com/](https://neonstatus.com/).

Please remember to bookmark the Neon Status page for easy access.
